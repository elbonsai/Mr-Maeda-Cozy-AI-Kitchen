Perhaps we APES will still have authentic leadership qualities that even the best AI will struggle to match for a while.\" ‚Äîvia [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/benedictsheppard_generativeai-ai-leadership-activity-7054828376380821504-2wSM?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accountability** - Leaders who embrace AI input, but personally shoulder responsibility for decisions, will be more respected than those who blame technology.\n",
    "- **Presence** - Leaders who disconnect from devices, truly engage with others, and listen intently will foster greater openness and empathy.\n",
    "- **Emotion** - Leaders who openly express their emotions will cultivate a familial atmosphere where others feel comfortable being honest and vulnerable.\n",
    "- **Sparkle** - Leaders who lead companies based on their authentic personal passions and imperfect human obsessions, whether than be cars or make-up, games or food, will inspire and energise those around them\n",

    "### With Ben, we look at the basics of AI *completion* models and how they work at the code level in the context of a fundamental concept in Design Thinking to consciously be customer-centric."
